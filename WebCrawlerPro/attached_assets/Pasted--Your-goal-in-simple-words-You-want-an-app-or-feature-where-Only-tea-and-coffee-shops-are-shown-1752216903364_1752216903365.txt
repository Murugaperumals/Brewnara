‚úÖ Your goal (in simple words)
You want an app or feature where:

Only tea and coffee shops are shown on a map in a given area.

Friends can share their live location if they‚Äôre visiting any of these places.

Friends can see each other‚Äôs locations on the same map in real time.

üó∫Ô∏è How Google Maps does this (high-level)
Map Data
Google uses huge location databases (places API) to show all types of places.
It filters them using categories ‚Äî e.g., cafe, coffee shop, tea house.

Live Location Sharing
Google lets you share your live location with specific people (contacts) using GPS.
This updates every few seconds to minutes.

Overlay on Map
Your location + friends‚Äô locations + places are shown as pins on the same map.

‚úÖ How YOUR version would work
Here‚Äôs the basic architecture:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Map & Places
Use a map service like Google Maps API, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap.

Use their Places API or your own database to only show:

Shops that are tagged as coffee or tea.

Or your own manually curated list if you want it local and special.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Live User Locations
Each user‚Äôs mobile device sends their live GPS coordinates to your backend server.

This can use sockets (like WebSocket) for real-time updates, or polling every few seconds.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Friends & Privacy
Each user can choose which friends see their location.

Store friend connections and permissions in your database.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Map Display
Your app fetches:

All nearby tea/coffee shops

Friends‚Äô locations

It shows both on the map with different icons (shop vs. friend).

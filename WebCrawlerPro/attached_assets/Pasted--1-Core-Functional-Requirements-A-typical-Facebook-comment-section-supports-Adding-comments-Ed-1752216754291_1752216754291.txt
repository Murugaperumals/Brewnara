📌 1. Core Functional Requirements
A typical Facebook comment section supports:

Adding comments

Editing and deleting your own comments

Replying to comments (nested comments)

Liking/reacting to comments

Loading new comments in real time

Handling spam and moderation

Notifications for replies or mentions

📌 2. Front-End Behavior
✅ Comment Input

Each post has a comment input field.

Supports rich text (emoji, mentions @User).

Sends input via AJAX/fetch to the server.

✅ Nested Comments

Comments are often displayed as a tree:

Parent comment → Child replies → Replies to replies.

Typically built with recursive components (e.g., React components).

✅ UI Interactions

Edit, delete, like, reply buttons for each comment.

Likes/reactions update counts immediately (optimistic UI).

✅ Real-Time Updates

Uses WebSockets or long polling.

If another user replies or likes, your UI updates instantly.

✅ Pagination & Lazy Loading

Loads only a few comments initially.

Load More button fetches additional comments when needed.

Infinite scroll for replies in deeply nested threads.

📌 3. Back-End Architecture
✅ Database Design
A basic schema for comments:

sql
Copy
Edit
Table: Comments
------------------------------
id             BIGINT (PK)
post_id        BIGINT (FK to Posts)
parent_id      BIGINT (nullable FK to Comments.id)
author_id      BIGINT (FK to Users)
content        TEXT
created_at     TIMESTAMP
updated_at     TIMESTAMP
likes_count    INT
deleted        BOOLEAN (soft delete)
parent_id enables nesting: top-level comments have NULL, replies store the parent comment’s ID.

Soft delete allows recovering a comment or showing “This comment was deleted.”

✅ Storing Reactions
Separate reactions table:

sql
Copy
Edit
Table: CommentReactions
------------------------------
id             BIGINT (PK)
comment_id     BIGINT (FK to Comments)
user_id        BIGINT (FK to Users)
reaction_type  ENUM('like', 'love', 'haha', 'angry', ...)
created_at     TIMESTAMP
This supports multiple reaction types, not just “like”.

✅ Mentions & Notifications

Parse @username mentions server-side.

Store mentions in a CommentMentions table.

Create notification jobs to alert mentioned users.

✅ Moderation

Content flagged by users goes into a review queue.

Spam detection (keyword filters, machine learning).

✅ APIs
Typical RESTful or GraphQL endpoints:

POST /comments — Add comment

GET /comments?post_id=... — Fetch comments with pagination

PATCH /comments/:id — Edit comment

DELETE /comments/:id — Soft delete

POST /comments/:id/reactions — Add/remove reaction

📌 4. Real-Time Functionality
✅ How comments update live:

When you post a comment:

Client sends it via API.

Server saves it and broadcasts a new event via WebSockets (using Socket.IO, Pusher, or a pub/sub system like Redis or Kafka).

All connected clients listening to that post ID receive the new comment event.

✅ Notifications

Similarly, a notification service broadcasts to user-specific channels when they’re mentioned or receive a reply.

📌 5. Performance Optimizations
✅ Caching

Frequently accessed comments are cached (e.g., Redis).

Use fan-out strategies for popular posts: write once, serve to many readers.

✅ Denormalization

Store likes_count directly on the comment row to avoid expensive count queries.

✅ Rate Limiting

Prevent spammy rapid posting or mass reactions.

✅ Sharding & Scaling

Comments for a post may be partitioned across multiple database shards for huge posts.

📌 6. Tech Stack Examples
✅ Front-end:

React/Vue for recursive comment trees

GraphQL or REST APIs

WebSocket library (Socket.IO)

✅ Back-end:

Node.js / Python / Java / Go

Relational DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Redis for caching and pub/sub

Kafka or similar for large-scale pub/sub events

✅ Security

CSRF and XSS protection (sanitize user input!)

Auth & permissions: only allow edits/deletes by owner

⚡ Putting It All Together
When you write a comment:

Front-end sends comment to the API.

API validates, stores, updates post’s comment count.

Server pushes a WebSocket event to subscribers.

All active users see the comment appear instantly.

If someone mentions you, you get a notification.

When you like a comment:

Client sends like request.

Server records it in CommentReactions.

Increments likes_count for fast reads.

Broadcasts update to all viewers.

✅ Summary: Facebook Comments Are...
A mix of:

Relational structure (tree for nesting)

Real-time updates (WebSockets/pub-sub)

User-friendly features (mentions, reactions)

Robust moderation & notifications

Scalable & performant (caching, sharding, fan-out)
